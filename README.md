# AvE - Actual vs Expected
### There are many machine learning visualisation tools out there for assessing goodness of fit. This is the one that is interactive and intuitive!
*A POC*

Features:
1. View actual and predicted values in one graph
2. Select amongst all predictor variables with a drop-down button - graphs the selected variable on the x-axis
3. Shows predicted median and percentiles in addition to the standard "single-point-estimate" mean value that most machine learning models output. Percentiles are determined by variying the selected predictor (step #2) and holding all other predictor variables constant.
